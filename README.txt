~~ SPACE INVADERS ~~
Goal: Defeat all of the space invaders, and you will win

You have three lives, and if you are hit by a laser from one of the invaders, then you will lose a life.
Also, if you let an invader touch you, then you will lose all of your lives.

As the time goes by, you will notice that the invaders pick up the pace, so be wary of that.
The bottom row of enemies shoots lasers. Also be wary of that.

If you lose more than once, you'll be given a handicap
